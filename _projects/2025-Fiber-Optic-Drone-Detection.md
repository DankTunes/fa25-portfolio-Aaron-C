As the project lead for PHANTOM—a mobile, helmet-integrated acoustic drone detection system under active development with MIT Lincoln Laboratory and JSOC/SOCOM—I’m guiding a multi-university team to deliver real-time, on-the-move counter-UAS awareness for dismounted operators in high-threat environments. The project and the team is truly interdiscplinary: our MEs use SolidWorks CAD to design rugged, field-serviceable sensor mounts and manpack enclosures along with testing hardware while the software team creates the embedded Python and MATLAB pipelines that filter audio, classify drone signatures, and triangulate threats—even amid motion, wind, and self-noise. Our system creates a dynamic bubble of acoustic awareness, compensating for platform dynamics to detect RF-silent and fiber-optic tethered UAS, then instantly pushes bearing and track data to ATAK and operator headsets via lightweight Android integration. Built with low-SWaP COTS components, hot-swap power, and modular interfaces, PHANTOM is engineered for expeditionary resilience and a SOF peculiar missionset, enabling special operations elements to maintain situational awareness and deploy countermeasures while infiltrating 5–20 km into contested areas where stationary sensors simply can’t follow.
