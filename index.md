## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/IMG_6445.JPEG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hi! My name's Aaron Chin. I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University (expected May 2027) with hands-on experience in defense, aerospace, and product development. Currently, I contribute to drone detection research at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and JSOC, leveraging my skills in Python, MATLAB, CAD (SolidWorks, Fusion 360), ANSYS FEA, and composite manufacturing. I'm passionate about innovative engineering solutions and working with people. In my spare time, I spend a lot of times outdoors and I coach archery at the Cornell Archery Club. Explore my projects in systems integration and ATAK here on GitHub.
